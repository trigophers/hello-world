# hello-world
first repository

   Hello, I'm trigophers, I love programming in c/c++, python, occasionally
JS, and I do crude initial testing on the site https://scratch.mit.edu, since
on Scratch there is no such thing as a syntax error, and I don't have to go 
through the trouble of creating a visual engine. (The Scratch Team already
did it for us all!)

   I like cats, data processing, rendering, visual data representation, 
and writing programs that read different types of files. I also love music
and art, even if I'm not very good at either...
